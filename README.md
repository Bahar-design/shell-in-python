This project is from codecrafter's "Build Your Own Shell" challenge using the Python language.

I built a POSIX compliant shell that may interpret shell commands, run external programs and
builtin commands like cd, pwd, echo and more. From this project I learned about shell command 
parsing, REPLs, builtin commands, and more.
